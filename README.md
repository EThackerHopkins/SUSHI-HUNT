# SUSHI HUNT
A Windows Form Application game created in 2015, where the player navigates a maze and collects pieces of sushi within a time limit. Players can achieve high scores depending on their completion time.

"Further Education College" is fictional, at least in the context of SUSHI HUNT and of my original assignment brief; this was indeed a college project, but the named establishment was intended to be purely fictional.

The font "Commodore PET" is supplied in a TrueType font file (TTF); installing this will allow SUSHI HUNT to display in-game text properly.

The soundtrack to SUSHI HUNT is available here: https://postapocolyptica.bandcamp.com/album/sushi-hunt-ost
