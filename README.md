# SUSHI HUNT
A Windows Form Application game created in 2015, where the player navigates a maze and collects pieces of sushi within a time limit. Players can achieve high scores depending on their completion time.

The font "Commodore PET" is supplied in a TrueType font file (TTF); installing this will allow SUSHI HUNT to display in-game text properly.

The soundtrack to SUSHI HUNT is available here: https://postapocolyptica.bandcamp.com/album/sushi-hunt-ost
